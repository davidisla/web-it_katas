# Web-IT Katas

The goal of this repo is to collect the code result after the Kata sessions that we have 
in the Web-IT department.

## What’s a Code Kata?

As a group, software developers don’t practice enough. Most of our learning takes place on the job, which means that
most of our mistakes get made there as well.

Other creative professions practice: artists carry a sketchpad, musicians play technical pieces, poets constantly
rewrite works. In karate, where the aim is to learn to spar or fight, most of a student’s time is spent learning and
refining basic moves. These are katas.

Katas exists to help developers get the same benefits as practicing in any other profession. There are simple,
artificial exercises that let you experiment and learn without the pressure of a production environment.

There are no right or wrong answers in any software kata: the benefit comes from the process, not from the result.

You can find a lot of katas-ideas here: https://github.com/gamontal/awesome-katas 

## How to work with it?

1. Clone the repo in your local.
2. Work in a new branch the kata that you're interested in.
